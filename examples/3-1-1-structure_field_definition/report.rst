Problem Description
===================

This test case illustrates definition of a field on structure field.

Field Center
===================

**Field** (`field_wiki`_) is a set on which addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division are defined 
and behave as the corresponding operations on rational and real numbers. 

Here, we defined a field on structure grid. The numbers are located on the center of 
each grid cells.

1 Dimension
-------------
The data store on the center of the grid. :numref:`fig-uniform1` shows the uniform structure grid 
in 1 dimension.

   :alt: Uniform Structure Grid 1D 
   :align: center 

   Uniform Structure Grid 1D.

`s_1` is size of a grid cell.

:numref:`fig-nonuniform1` shows the none uniform structure grid 
in 1 dimension. The size of each grid cell are different.

   NonUniform Structure Grid 1D.
